                <p> Abortion rights are something that has been fought for in the U.S. for many years.U.S. politicians in the late 1800s started first started bannng abortions. This had some legal risks such as surveillance, arrest, investigation, prosecution and other penalties.</p>
                <p>In 1973, The Supreme Court ruled Roe V. Wade, the case that legalized abortion in the United States. Safe and legal abortion was a federal constitutional right across the country for almost 50 years.</p>
                <p> Nowadays, however, in June of 2022, the Supreme Court made the decision to overturn Roe V. Wade and ended this constitutional right to abortion in the U.S. Some states allow the right to have an abortion, while others do not.</p>

                <h2>Why They Matter</h2>
                <p>Abortion rights matter. It is important that women have the rights to an abortion. Restrictive abortion laws violate women's rights, such as the right to health, equality, privacy, and the freedom from discrimination. </p>
                <p>Unwanted pregnancies can cause a lot of stress and problems in a woman's life, and takig the right to an abortion away just adds on to this stress even more. </p>
